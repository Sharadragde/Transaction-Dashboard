The Transaction Dashboard is a web application that organizes and displays transaction data interactively. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it uses
raw JSON data to allow users to view transaction summaries filtered by month or specific products. This tool is especially useful for tracking trends,
sales insights, or analyzing transaction flows over selected time periods.
